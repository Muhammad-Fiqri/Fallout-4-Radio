# Tailwind Exercise By Making Fallout 4 Radio App with Tailwind.css

I made this website so I can learn Tailwind CSS, turns out it's just already written CSS that is linked to a specific class
to easeup coding, this way front-end dev can make css with inline-css no need for separate css.

Library I used in this project: <br>
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-wavify">react-wavify</a><br>
Tailwind CSS<br>
React JS<br>
Inter Google Font<br>
