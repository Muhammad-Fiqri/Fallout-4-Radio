# Tailwind Exercise By Making Fallout 4 Radio App with Tailwind.css

I made this website so I can learn Tailwind CSS, turns out it's just already written CSS that is linked to a specific class
to easeup coding, this way front-end dev can make css with inline-css no need for separate css.

Library I used in this project: 
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-wavify">react-wavify</a>
Tailwind CSS
React JS
Inter Google Font

Version Alpha 1:
1. The Wave Now Play When Station is Chosen
2. The Green Square Now Set When Station is Chosen
3. Music Also Plays In The Background

Next Goal:
1. Make The Music Actually Play Lives
